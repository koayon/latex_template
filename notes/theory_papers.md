# Structure for Theory Papers

This advice is for empirical papers and theory papers are often very different so much will not be applicable.

I think there are two main structures of theory papers which work well:

## Theorem driven

1. Intro
2. Intuitively here's what we're going to argue and why it matters
3. Meat - Definitions, Lemma, Proof, Theorem, Proof, Corollary, Proof, Examples
4. Discussion - here's why this matters and what the upshot is

<!-- Cf Demba Ba papers -->

## Narrative-driven

1. Intro
2. Narrative Point 1
3. Narrative Point 2
4. Narrative Point 3
5. Discussion

This is the hardest to get right but can be pretty effective and gives a chance for some really nice exposition if you're a good writer.
Here you can have the theorems/proofs in the text be informal sketches and refer readers to the rigorous proofs in the appendix (if applicable)

<!-- 6. Cf: Position papers, Interpretability as Compression, Standard SAEs Might Be Incoherent -->
