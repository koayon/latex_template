# Context

## Target Audience

<!-- Who are the target audience?
Who do you mostly expect to read the full paper?
What conference/community would you be ideally publishing in?
Who do you hope the paper gets to for non-technical readers (e.g. policy, other media, other disciplines)?
How does thinking about the target audience make you change how you're approaching the content and style? -->

<!-- You can refer back to the Target Audience when  -->

<!-- - PhD students and industry AI Safety researchers
- Has some understand of X but doesn't have the necessary background in Y
- Most people are unlikely to read the whole thing so it's important that the figures, abstract and introduction explain most of the relevant information; similarly the appendix should not contain any vital information for understanding the work. -->

## Topic Sentence (Shiny Dime)

<!--
Analyse this and then rewrite and then rewrite again.
The shiny dime is the best thing to work out with co-authors
with a whiteboard and an extended discussion.
Once you have that its much easier to decide what to include
in the paper, what experiments to run, where to put emphasis,
what to leave out etc.
