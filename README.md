# LaTeX Template for Empirical ML Papers

This repository contains a LaTeX template for empirical machine learning papers. It's set up so that you can focus on writing the content of your paper, rather than worrying about formatting and provides some opinionated advice for how to structure and conceptualise your paper.

## Acknowledgements

The advice here is based on the following resources:

I'm also inspired by my wonderful co-authors Lee Sharkey and Michael Pearce as well as the many other people who have given me feedback on my writing.

## Reference Papers

Some reference papers to look at for inspiration include:
- [OpenAI's SAEs](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/sparse-autoencoders.pdf)
- [Jump-ReLU SAEs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14435)
- [GPT-Q](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.17323)
- [vec2text](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06816)

## Usage

This project is a template so you can use it to start your own paper with GitHub's template feature.

## Contributions

I'm always on the lookout for ways to improve this template, both with formatting and advice on technical writing. If you have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue or a pull request. I'd also love any links to either well-written papers or resources on technical writing that you'd recommend.
