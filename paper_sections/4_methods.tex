Our approach is as follows...

% When using a variable that hasn't appeared in a while, remind the reader what it is (i.e., "the sample space X" rather than "X".
% All of the notation here should be defined in the Background and Related Work sections.

% This should be very technical:
% "If I had to do this again from scratch, what would I need to know?"
% Here you should also have enough information for someone to reproduce the whole paper;
% if there are technical details elsewhere (e.g. background), make sure to reference or reintroduce.
% If there are technical details in the appendix, be sure to add a reference to that.

%  Everything in this section should be tested in the Results section.
%  If you're not testing it, cut it.

% Modularising your method and making this into subsections is typically a good approach (see the Tripod paper).

% End with an algorithm where possible.
