% A set of experiments that usefully explore how good/interesting the method/model/central investigation of the paper is, and which tell a clear and cohesive story.
% Everything that appears in the Methods/Experimental Setup section should be tested, with ablations if feasible.

% We want to show absolute performance, performance relative to baselines and previous methods
% and performance compared to other methods introduced in this work and/or ablations.
