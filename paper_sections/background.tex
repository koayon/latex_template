\subsection{Subsection 1}
\label{sec:one}

% Most of the theoretical background, notation, ideas should be rigorously introduced here.
% Here we're going to specify the framing/formalism that we provide for the problem.
% This section should be highly technical - it should practically "compile". It should type check.

% Here we add sufficient but minimal notation to later explain your contribution.
% If you find there's anything in here which is not later referenced, cut it out.
% And vice versa, if you find yourself needing to introduce a new concept later, come back here and introduce it.

% There should be nothing in this section which a reader doesn't need to know to understand or contextualise the later results.
% Don't describe attention/transformers if you're not making a modification to the attention mechanism etc.

% Papers are alley-oops. This is effectively the setup for the slam-dunk of your results section.
