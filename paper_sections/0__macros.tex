% It's generally worth making some macros for commonly used notation in your paper here.
% E.g. \newcommand{\probability}{P}

\newcommand{\fix}{\marginpar{FIX}}
\newcommand{\new}{\marginpar{NEW}}

\newcommand{\x}{\mathbf{x}}
\newcommand{\z}{\mathbf{z}}

% Adding aliases here helps you to be consistent with notation and to see all the notation
% that you use in the paper at a glance.
% This is especially useful if you refactor notation for the paper across multiple files!
