% WHAT WE DID



% THE RESULTS



% FUTURE WORK

% It's also a pretty good exercise for you to think about ways that you might extend this in a follow-up paper.

% Most of the future work will be about technical research but it may also be worth thinking
% about if there are any implications for policy or other disciplines.

% End on something positive about your work where possible and the impact it could have on the field.
