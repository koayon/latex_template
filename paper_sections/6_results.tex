% Shows the results of running our Method in the setting described in the Experimental Setup section.
% Includes reasonable comparisons and ablations so that all the claims we made in the Abstract and Intro are justified.

% The purpose of this section is to check the contributions of the paper.
% Not to introduce new ideas. No new methods or datasets should be introduced here (put it in the Methods and Experimental Setup sections).
% From the Methods and Experimental Setup section, readers should basically be able to guess exactly the experiments you're going to run.

% A set of experiments that usefully explore how good/interesting the method/model/central investigation of the paper is, and which tell a clear and cohesive story.
% Everything that appears in the Methods/Experimental Setup section should be tested, with ablations if feasible.

% We want to show absolute performance, performance relative to baselines and previous methods
% and performance compared to other methods introduced in this work and/or ablations.

% [PARAGRAPH EXPLAINING SUPPORTING CHARTS]

% Each table/chart should show the results of a single experiment.
% Try to go for at least one chart and one table here.
% For additional results (either here or the appendix),
% prefer charts to tables when it's unclear which to choose.

% Where possible include error bars on charts and confidence intervals in tables.
