% Use others' work to make it clear how your contribution differs from previous work.
% Ironically this is the best place to show your own method's novelty.

% Try to keep the notation consistent but if there's a choice of notation use our notation rather than theirs.

% Should have a lot of citations for the true literature heads out there (we salute you ðŸ«¡).
% Citing a review paper is typically a good idea to cover a few bases.

% Note some recent papers move this to right before the conclusion as "Discussion and Future Work".
